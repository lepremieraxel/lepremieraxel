# 🌍 WELCOME TO MY WORLD!

Hello, my name is **Axel**, I'm **21** and I'm from France 🥖.
I've just graduated from a bachelor's degree in “multimedia and internet professions”.
I'm a **web developer**, rather **front-end** oriented, with an attraction for **web design**, **layout** and **graphics**. I've been working with __html__ and __css__ for over **8 years** now, first out of curiosity, then I developed a passion for web development.
Today, I use my own boilerplate based on __PiecesJs__ combined with __Sanity__ to create **creative** and **immersive** web experiences. I also know how to use __Shopify__ and its __Liquid__ language to create **personalized** e-commerce sites.
