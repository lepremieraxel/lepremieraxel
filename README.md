I'm **Axel**, I'm 18 and I come from France. :fr:

I discovered computer science and development a few years ago now and since then I'm passionate about it. 🖥️

I'm more interested in web development but I'm a bit interested in everything. I've been learning web development since I was in high-school and I'm now doing a [BUT MMI](https://www.onisep.fr/Ressources/Univers-Formation/Formations/Post-bac/but-metiers-du-multimedia-et-de-l-internet) in France. 🎓
